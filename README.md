# Optimization

Package used for mathematical optimization.
It implements multiple different stochastic gradient descent variations used
to optimize multivariate functions.

## Usage

Your object that needs to be optimized has to implement Optimizable.
Then create a new Optimizer and override keepTraining to tell it when to stop,
give it your object and call the optimization algorithm you like!
(Adam is recommended!)

## Getting Started

Simply download this repository and add it to your project as a new package!
Done!
